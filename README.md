# Analysis of Childs Height and Age
Explored child's age-height relationship using real data. Clean, visualize, and model data with linear regression. Predict height based on age, evaluate accuracy. Insights into growth patterns through data analysis.

## Introduction:
In this data analysis, we explore the relationship between a child's age and their height. Height is an essential indicator of a child's growth and development, and understanding its correlation with age can provide valuable insights into childhood health and growth patterns. Through data cleaning, visualization, and regression modeling, we aim to uncover the nature of this relationship and quantify its strength.

## Description:
We begin by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset containing responses about children's age and height. Data cleaning is carried out to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information. Negative or zero values for height, which are not possible for children, are removed during this process. Duplicate entries are also eliminated to maintain the quality of the dataset.

Next, we focus on feature engineering, selecting the 'Age in years' and 'Height in inches' columns for further analysis. Visualization is employed to plot a scatter plot, providing a visual representation of the data points where height is plotted against age. This scatter plot helps us understand the distribution of height with respect to age.

To quantify the correlation between age and height, Pearson's coefficient (correlation coefficient) is calculated. This statistical measure indicates the strength and direction of the linear relationship between these two variables. A positive coefficient suggests a positive correlation, implying that as age increases, height tends to increase as well.

## Objective:
The objective of this data analysis is to explore the correlation between a child's age and their height. By utilizing statistical techniques and visualization methods, we aim to uncover the nature of this relationship and evaluate its strength. This analysis seeks to provide insights into the growth patterns of children and contribute to our understanding of childhood development.

## Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that there exists a positive correlation between a child's age and their height. As children grow older, their height is expected to increase proportionally. This relationship is based on the common understanding that height is a key indicator of physical development, and it is generally expected that children will experience growth in height as they advance in age. Through statistical analysis and visualization, we aim to validate this hypothesis and quantify the extent of the correlation between age and height.

## Model and Outcomes:
We employ Linear Regression, a fundamental statistical technique, to model the relationship between age and height. The model aims to fit a straight line that best represents the relationship between these variables. The coefficients of the linear equation provide insights into the rate of change in height per unit of age.

The dataset is split into training and testing subsets using the train_test_split() function from the scikit-learn library. This division allows us to assess the model's performance on unseen data. The Linear Regression model is trained on the training subset and evaluated on the testing subset.

Through the model evaluation, we calculate key metrics such as R-squared, coefficients, standard errors, and p-values. These metrics help us assess the goodness of fit of the model and its ability to predict height based on age accurately. The R-squared value quantifies the proportion of variance in height that can be explained by age. A high R-squared value indicates a strong relationship between age and height.

The outcome of this analysis is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between a child's age and their height. By employing data visualization and Linear Regression modeling, we aim to provide valuable insights into childhood growth patterns, aiding healthcare professionals, researchers, and parents in understanding the factors that influence a child's physical development.
